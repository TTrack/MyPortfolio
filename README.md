# MyPortfolio
Hello there

Jonatas here. I am trying GitHub for the first time. I am excited to start coding and playing around with Python, HTML, and... I do not know. I will creat a professional portfolio as my first project. I hope I can enjoy doing it, or at least trying it, as I am not a IT professional. I am a environmental engineer. I found coding a very interesting hobby and I want to improve it as a personal skill. 

That's it. 

Cheers,

Jonatas Marques
